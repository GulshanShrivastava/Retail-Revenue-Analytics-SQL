- Business Intelligence Concepts

  ## Database Structure

The project uses a relational retail database with the following tables:

- customers (customer_id, name, city, join_date)
- products (product_id, product_name, category, price)
- orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, region)
- order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity)

The tables are connected using primary and foreign key relationships.

## SQL Query Example

```sql
SELECT o.region,
       SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY o.region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

## SQL Query Example

```sql
SELECT o.region,
       SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id

GROUP BY o.region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
